Graph Fragment Language for Easy Syntactic Annotation
=====================================================

Lightweight dependency-style annotations, featuring multiwords and latent nodes.
by Chris Dyer, Brendan O'Connor, David Bamman; Carnegie Mellon University.

This is pre-alpha and not ready for anything real!
And we aren't done with the document that actually describes all this.
But the directories are:

parser/ -- a parser for the GFL annotations format.
scripts/ -- a tool for checking and visualizing them, in GraphViz.
anno/   -- some annotated sentences.


Getting started
===============

The viewer needs Python 2.7 and GraphViz ("dot" command) to be installed.  Run:

  scripts/view.py anno/tweets/dev.0000.anno
  scripts/view.py -w anno/tweets/dev.0000.anno
  scripts/view.py anno/nietzsche.anno

etc.
